# NeuroTech-Projects
1) NeuralNetwork1:Developed a neural network model using Keras and Tensorflow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.Experimented with different configurations, architectures, and activation functions to optimize model performance. 
Utilized data preprocessing techniques such as normalization and one-hot encoding to prepare data for training and validation.
2) NeuroEEG:
Created a Python program to analyze EEG data using the pandas and matplotlib libraries.Processed the raw data from an EDF file and converted it to a CSV format for analysis.
Plotted voltage amplitude over time for all EEG channels using line graphs, identifying and labeling different parts of the data.
